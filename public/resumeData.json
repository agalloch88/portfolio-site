    "bio": "Hi there! I'm Ryan! I've been coding for over 3 years now. As a junior Full Stack developer, I've worked on many personal projects, and recently completed a six-month bootcamp via Nucamp to gain my MERN Full Stack credentials. After 10 years in finance, I realized my passion for development and engineering, and understood I wanted to make this my career. I'm looking for a full-time position, and bring REAL VALUE through my work ethic, project management experience, and financial industry knowledge. Switching careers is not easy, but it's certainly made easier when you find something you love.",
