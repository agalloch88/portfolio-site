    "bio": "Hi there! I'm Ryan! I’m a full stack software engineer with experience building modern Cloud, CRM & eCommerce solutions. I thrive in challenging environments where I can continue to grow in my learning leveraging modern technologies. With my experience in both sales and IT project management, I lead cross-functional teams by fostering creative and diverse ideas that optimize systems and workflows. I’m always focused on orchestrating better customer experience through better understanding of end-user experience. Most recently I completed Backend Python Web Development, PostgreSQL with Python, and DevOps with Python Certificate through Nucamp Coding Bootcamp to gain new skills. Right now, I’m enjoying challenging myself in the third cohort of Plutus Pioneers, which will allow me to further and hone my blockchain development skills. Follow me to see my progress! I aim to leverage my attention to detail, ability to calculate risk, and analytical skills to drive better decision making across the business. Always open to professional collaboration and networking. Let’s connect!",
